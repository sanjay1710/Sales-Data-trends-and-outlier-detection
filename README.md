Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing sales data from an e-commerce platform to uncover key insights about sales performance, customer demographics, and product popularity. The analysis aims to identify trends, detect outliers, and provide actionable recommendations for sales optimization and inventory management. The project includes data cleaning, exploration, visualization, and presenting findings using Python libraries such as Matplotlib, Seaborn, Trenda, and Outliers.

 Libraries Used
Matplotlib: For basic visualizations like bar charts, line graphs, and histograms.
Seaborn: For advanced statistical visualizations such as heatmaps, box plots, and violin plots.
Trends: A tool for identifying trends in sales data, detecting seasonality, and analyzing growth patterns.
Outliers: A library or method used for detecting outliers in sales data to highlight unusual data points.

Features
Data Cleaning: 
    - Removing irrelevant or missing data.
    - Handling missing values and standardizing data.
    - Converting categorical data into numeric values.
    
Data Analysis:
    - Descriptive statistics to understand sales data trends.
    - Segmentation by customer demographics (age, location, etc.).
    - Correlation analysis to identify relationships between sales, demographics, and product categories.

Trend Detection:
    - Time series analysis to uncover seasonality and sales patterns.
    - Identifying long-term growth or decline trends.

Outlier Detection:
    - Identifying and visualizing outliers that may represent errors or unusual behaviors.
  
Visualization:
    - Line plots for time-based trends.
    - Bar charts for product popularity.
    - Box plots and histograms for customer demographics.
    - Heatmaps for correlation analysis.
